HYPOTHESIS

1.  Conservation of a.m. might help to bring the body forward in the first phase of the step.
    See short_leg_no_friction_bent_start_pi66_t2.mp4 and notes

2.  Instability might be due to:
    a)  in decelerating the shoulder joint at the end of the movement, but this might not be a 
        problem for the actual fish, since it can stop using the constraint and just "release" 
        all the weight on the ground
    b)  at some point the girdle receive counteracting actions from the shoulder and the body
        at the end of the movement the shoulder try to slow down and keep a fixed angle, while
        the body movement would make the girdle rotate. This might be what leads to the behaviour 
        of a multiple pendulum
